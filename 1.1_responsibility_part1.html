Meanwhile, the end-user who is insistent on committing knife crimes will just opt for using clubs instead.

Their role is often dismissed as "just infrastructure," but they power the very scale that amplifies systemic misrepresentation. With great scale comes shared responsibility."</li>                    <li>"AI infrastructure providers should be highly responsible, just like the hosting providers for internet fora or social media. The content should be 'Unfair discrimination and misrepresentation' and they are very important to reach that goal."</li>                    <li>"I rate infrastructure as higher responsibility because they have the ability to de-platform bad actors."</li>                    <li>"AI infrastructure providers not only include data providers, they also control what models are available and often what verification mechanisms are available and at what price.  Specialist developers are very often inheriting decisions and capabilities of the platform.  For instance many developers will just turn on the Azure AI bias detection and trust its doing its job as advertised,  so the Infrastructure provider ends up being highly responsible.  Its also the case that spending more compute on reasoning or adversarial review can often get you more accuracy and less bias,  but that makes services less cost competitive.  So the provider cost/performance profile for bias detection mechanisms is a primary lever for discrimination and misrepresentation.  

Users are not free from responsibility here either, bias literacy, source checking, output review practices and subsequent decisions are crucial steps in managing the impact of model bias which can't all be handled upstream."</li>                    <li>"AI Infrastructure Provider, for instance, NVIDIA, has tremendous leverage in the development of AI via its sheer market power, direct partnerships with AI Developers and Researchers, lobbying power with the policymakers."</li>                    <li>"I still think that AI Infrastructure Providers are primarily responsible. If they only provide the developed infrastructure to certain companies, it'd lead to pushing certain types of AI products to the market. It means that alternative approaches developed by small companies cannot find sufficient resources to develop their technologies. There should definitely be a share of resources policy (for instance, in the case of GPUs) to provide the equal distribution of fundamental resources."</li>
