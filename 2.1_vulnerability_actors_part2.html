They don't directly control data but host infrastructure where data is processed, and security breaches could lead to unauthorized access. As intermediaries handling sensitive data, they manage powerful aggregation points including multi-tenant isolation, snapshots, observability pipelines, vector stores, and KMS. Risks center on misconfiguration, insider threat, cross-tenant faults, and metadata/traffic analysis, though some noted vulnerability would increase where providers offer managed services that process plaintext.</p>

                    <li>"AI Infrastructure Provider - changed to Moderately vulnerable
Reasoning (Exposure &amp; Sensitivity): Core infra primarily provides compute/storage/network with strong tenant isolation and encryption by default; content is usually handled at the application/deployer layer, so direct exposure to plaintext PII is limited. Residual risks center on misconfiguration, insider threat, cross-tenant faults, and metadata/traffic analysis rather than routine access to content. A compromise could be serious, but layered controls and limited default visibility into application data justify a "Moderate" vulnerability rather than "High." I would revisit upward where the provider offers managed services that process plaintext (e.g., hosted feature stores, fine-tuning/logging that captures content, or hands-on support with data access)."</li>                    <li>"AI Infrastructure Provider - changed to Highly Vulnerable because cloud and data center providers host sensitive datasets and logs, making them targets for intrusion or accidental exposure"</li>                    <li>"Infrastructure Providers have moderate vulnerability as intermediaries handling sensitive data."</li>

                            <p class="summary-text"><strong>AI-generated summary of expert comments:</strong> Respondents emphasized vulnerability because affected stakeholders are direct subjects of privacy violations and face the most extreme sensitivity to privacy breaches, especially vulnerable communities. They may be indirectly affected through automated decisions or data leaks, with high sensitivity despite potentially lower exposure. Poor and less-educated people are less likely to have political power or knowledge to protect their rights and data. Even with growing regulatory safeguards and organizational accountability, enforcement and remediation remain limited once data is compromised—stakeholders have little practical control over secondary use or model retention, leaving them exposed to irreversible privacy and reputational harm.</p>

Literature shows AI leaks personal data and violates GDPR, and deployers are exposed to cyber-attack risks. As operators of embeddings, RAG indexes, fine-tuning sets, prompt/response logs, and multi-vendor chains, deployers directly handle customer and employee data plus trade secrets, creating exposure through data pipelines, vector databases, analytics, and access controls. They face regulatory notification, DPA exposure, contractual liability, and reputation loss from privacy compromises, and they operationalize what developers built by putting systems into live environments.</p>

Reasoning (Exposure &amp; Sensitivity): As the operator of embeddings/RAG indexes, fine-tuning sets, prompt/response logs, and multi-vendor chains, the deployer directly handles customer and employee data as well as trade secrets. That surface includes data pipelines, vector databases, analytics, and access/permissioning where mis-scoping and vendor retention can lead to disclosure or correct sensitive-attribute inference. The harm from a privacy compromise is high-regulatory notification, DPA exposure, contractual liability, and reputation loss. I did not mark this "Extreme" because in a typical enterprise stack there are mitigating controls (data minimization/redaction, zero-retention inference options, tenant isolation, KMS/RBAC, deletion SLAs); absent evidence that plaintext is widely accessible or retained across teams, "High" is the calibrated rating."</li>                    <li>"Developers and Deployers face high vulnerability due to reputational harm and legal liability from data breaches."</li>                    <li>"The AI deployers face risk because they are using AI to process their and customer data.  If they do not take proper precautions, they spill the data.  However, at least larger organizations should have GRC in place to help reduce the risk of spills.  They should have the knowledge to either have the AI in-house or are paying for AI that protects their data."</li>                    <li>"AI Developers and Deployers: it is already shown in the literature how AI leaks personal data and violates GDPR. They are also exposed to cyber-attack risks"</li>

They don't directly control data but host infrastructure where data is processed, and security breaches could lead to unauthorized access. As intermediaries handling sensitive data, they manage powerful aggregation points including multi-tenant isolation, snapshots, observability pipelines, vector stores, and KMS. Risks center on misconfiguration, insider threat, cross-tenant faults, and metadata/traffic analysis, though some noted vulnerability would increase where providers offer managed services that process plaintext.</p>

                    <li>"AI Infrastructure Provider - changed to Moderately vulnerable
Reasoning (Exposure &amp; Sensitivity): Core infra primarily provides compute/storage/network with strong tenant isolation and encryption by default; content is usually handled at the application/deployer layer, so direct exposure to plaintext PII is limited. Residual risks center on misconfiguration, insider threat, cross-tenant faults, and metadata/traffic analysis rather than routine access to content. A compromise could be serious, but layered controls and limited default visibility into application data justify a "Moderate" vulnerability rather than "High." I would revisit upward where the provider offers managed services that process plaintext (e.g., hosted feature stores, fine-tuning/logging that captures content, or hands-on support with data access)."</li>                    <li>"AI Infrastructure Provider - changed to Highly Vulnerable because cloud and data center providers host sensitive datasets and logs, making them targets for intrusion or accidental exposure"</li>                    <li>"Infrastructure Providers have moderate vulnerability as intermediaries handling sensitive data."</li>

They may be indirectly affected through automated decisions or data leaks, with high sensitivity despite potentially lower exposure. Poor and less-educated people are less likely to have political power or knowledge to protect their rights and data. Even with growing regulatory safeguards and organizational accountability, enforcement and remediation remain limited once data is compromised—stakeholders have little practical control over secondary use or model retention, leaving them exposed to irreversible privacy and reputational harm.</p>
