The private sectors will have huge dependency on the Government thus with right kind of regulations the catasthropic consequences of AI system can be brought down to zero level. However, Govt needs to be careful enough while they are incorporating AI system in their defense sector.

I think there is a category error at work here. Saying AI governance actors are responsible for AI risks is like saying that judges are responsible for crimes being committed. The kind of responsibility a judge has is very different from the kind of responsibility that a criminal or a lock-pick-maker has. The better way to think of this is that the AI governance actor is responsible for holding responsible the actor who is properly responsible. It would be recursive that AI governance actor is themselves responsible. Would we propose some meta-AI-goverance governor who holds responsible the AI governance actors that fail to hold responsible the actors that should be responsible? This is not the right way of thinking."</p>
