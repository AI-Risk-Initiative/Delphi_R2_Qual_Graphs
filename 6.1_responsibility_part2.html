This isn't a one-man band - it's a coordinated system, and no single actor should bear the burden alone.

While developers and deployers have technical control, governance actors shape the conditions, and users participate in and reinforce the structures that form around AI systems. If we're serious about building an equitable future, we need to move from blame assignment to distributed accountability. That's why I opted for a moderate responsibility rating across the board - not to minimize the risk, but to reflect a more realistic and collaborative approach to solving it."</li>                    <li>"AI Governance Actors and AI Deployers are rated as extremely responsible because they influence the way benefits and risks are distributed across society by defining market access, data ownership, etc."</li>                    <li>"Developers, Deployers, Infrastructure Providers are incentivized to facilitate centralization of power and unfair distribution of benefits resultant from development and deployment of AI systems through shareholder obligations."</li>
