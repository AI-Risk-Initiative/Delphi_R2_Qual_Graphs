Under Business as Usual, economic and cultural devaluation is already occurring and baked into current economic and political systems. Under Pragmatic Mitigations, low-cost steps do not address realized losses or severe/catastrophic tails. Multiple experts emphasize this risk would require radical transformation of values similar to what's needed for climate change and is easily eliminable with political will and corporate responsibility, yet such transformation remains unlikely as long as capital continues its current dominance. Targeted mitigations like stricter disengagement policies, clearer human-machine interfaces, broader recalls, and independent audits could meaningfully reduce specific harms like self-driving crashes.</p>

                                <li>"I think even with regulations and mitigations, devaluation of human labour and effort is something that will happen over time and is baked into our economic and political systems. AI will only exacerbate this even with mitigations. We would need such radical transformation and reorienting of values that it's impossible. Similarly to the imperative to reorient values to tackle climate change, we will not meet this challenge as long as capital continues to hold the sway it has."</li>
                                <li>"Substantial harm (40%) and Severe harm (25%) under the Pragmatic Mitigations scenario because pragmatic interventions reduce risks, but significant risks (such as devaluing labor) still remain."</li>
                                <li>"The likelihood that these mitigations will be rolled out in time is the challenge, but a completely easy to eliminate risk if there was political will and corporate responsibility"</li>
                                <li>"Business as Usual: I set 0% negligible harm. Ongoing labor disruption and unemployment among recent software-engineering graduates already produced losses &gt;$10k in 2025.

Pragmatic Mitigations: I also set 0% negligible harm. The proposed low-cost steps do not address those realized losses or the plausible severe/catastrophic tails over five years.

Substantial harm: rising incidents with self-driving features already illustrate economic devaluation of human effort (driver attention). A 1-99 deaths outcome looks likely for 2025-2030, if not already reached, given National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reporting on self-driving crashes. Targeted mitigations-stricter disengagement policies, clearer HMI, broader recalls, independent audits-could cut that risk meaningfully."</li>
