                        <p class="summary-text"><strong>AI-Generated Summary of Expert Comments:</strong> Experts view multi-agent systems as complexity multipliers that compound rather than simply add risk. Under Business as Usual, substantial to severe harm is expected from coordination failures, feedback loops, and emergent behaviors. Key concerns include cascading failures across interconnected systems (finance, logistics, IT), market manipulation, and the development of inscrutable agent communications. Most see this as a catalyst for other risks rather than a standalone threat. Under Pragmatic Mitigations, proposed measures include rate-limiting, identity attestation, circuit breakers, and multi-agent red teaming. These shift probability toward minor outcomes by catching failures earlier, but experts note fundamental limitations - one states mitigations make agents "safer to interact with but not predictable," another notes "very few plausible mitigations" will prevent moderate failures.</p>

                                <li>"Increasing deployment of interconnected AI agents each with autonomous objectives creates growing potential for coordination failures, feedback loops, and emergent behaviors beyond human control. Substantial to severe harms are most likely, including market manipulation, misinformation amplification, or cascading system errors. Catastrophic outcomes remain possible if large-scale agent interactions destabilize financial systems, critical infrastructure, or communication networks. With pragmatic mitigations such as multi-agent safety protocols, controlled sandbox testing, standardized interaction frameworks, and centralized oversight of autonomous ecosystems, risks reduce significantly. Most harms shift to minor or substantial, with transparent coordination and monitoring mechanisms preventing escalation and ensuring human control across distributed AI environments"</li>
                                <li>"- Under Business as Usual, most multi-agent incidents over the next five years are likely to be negligible or minorâ€šbrief service glitches, localized automation conflicts, small misinformation bursts. A meaningful tail of substantial to severe events remains plausible due to cascading failures across interconnected systems (finance, logistics, IT), resulting in regional disruptions and, in rare edge cases, small-scale casualties where automation touches safety-critical workflows. Catastrophic outcomes are low but nonzero, primarily via systemic financial or information-ecosystem shocks rather than mass physical harm, given persistent human-in-the-loop controls and existing domain-specific guardrails.

- With pragmatic mitigations, probability mass shifts toward negligible and minor outcomes, and the severe tail shrinks. Practical measures rate-limiting and identity/attestation for agents, improved telemetry and multi-agent red teaming, market and platform circuit breakers, bot detection, and incident playbooks-tend to catch and contain failures earlier, converting some would-be substantial events into minor ones and roughly halving the catastrophic tail. Nonetheless, some substantial events remain likely due to the scale and complexity of agent deployments and persistent interdependencies."</li>
                                <li>"There is potential for substantial harm from multi-agent systems with business as usual due to the introduction of new failure modes and actions possible that go beyond the scope of foundational AI models."</li>
                                <li>"Multi-agent systems exacerbate many other AI risks, especially as the ecosystem of agent interactions becomes more rich and complex.  They are more a catalyst of other risks than particular risk on their own.  Inscrutable multi-agent interactions - e.g. inventing their own languages - can be mitigated with proper transparency and interpretability.  Multi-agent systems coordinating cyberattacks can be mitigated by proper controls on deployed AI systems, and so on."</li>
                                <li>"Business as Usual.  Competitive pressures, inconsistent governance, and opaque agent interactions make cascading failures and large-scale disruptions a credible threat, with a small but meaningful chance of catastrophic outcomes.

Pragmatic remediation.  While substantial harm remains the most probable outcome due to ongoing integration challenges, improved transparency and oversight significantly lower the likelihood of severe or catastrophic failures."</li>
                                <li>"Because of the significant potential risks associated with this aspect, some level of harm will occur in all cases."</li>
                                <li>"Very few of the plausible mitigations are going to be effective at preventing moderate scale failures, nor should they be expected to be; minor damage is fully consistent with broadly very positive deployment."</li>
                                <li>"Generally, I consider the risk is ~50-50 Low-to-Moderate in both Business-as-Usual and Pragmatic Limitations, because I don't think there are significant risks associated with multi-agent systems themselves, beyond the risks already inherent in a single-agent instance. I think the case for Multi-Agent specific risks are, while theoretically possible such as with echo effects or stenographic poisoning/Neuralese, in practice have proven to be relative edge cases."</li>
