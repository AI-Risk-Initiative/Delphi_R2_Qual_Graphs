                            <p class="summary-text"><strong>AI-generated summary of expert comments:</strong> Governance actors bear high to extreme responsibility—even more than private companies—because it ultimately falls on them to protect the public and enact regulations and enforcement. They set rules and oversight mechanisms that prevent or enable misuse, have obligation to regulate and capability to enforce standards, and must mandate provenance/labeling, acceptable use policy enforcement, and cross-platform response coordination. Intelligence agencies may need to retain records of citizen-AI contacts to understand foreign control mechanisms, especially regarding election influence operations.</p>

                    <li>"Upstream data providers have a particularly strong responsibility here. If a foundation model producer has outsourced their data aquisition to offshore providers, they may also have introduced sleeper agents into their models without realising. Anthropic's research on this topic showed Deployers and downstream developers have no realistic way to fine tune out sleeper agent behaviour, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't be trying to detect it and intervene.  

Ultimately intelligence agencies may need to retain records of all contacts between citizens and AIs if they wish to understand foreign ownership and control mechanisms within their society, as it may be less transparently interogatable than other telecommunications techniques as a means of hiding correspondence and influence.  

This is particularly pronounced when countries are trying to influence each other's elections. In Taiwan the CCP created AI video of ballot boxed being stuffed. In Ukraine russia has used AI to generate memes and social media virality.  The US is particularly adept at these techniques and as the major model provider it should be expected that it will leverage it as a soft power and foreign influence tool, if not as a recruitment and asset handling service."</li>                    <li>"Developers and deployers bear primary responsibility given their direct control over system design and deployment choices.
