Saying AI governance actors are responsible for AI risks is like saying that judges are responsible for crimes being committed. The kind of responsibility a judge has is very different from the kind of responsibility that a criminal or a lock-pick-maker has. The specific question asks how responsible should the AI governance actor be for addressing the risk. In almost all cases, the AI governance actor is responsible for requiring some other actor to address the risk, not addressing the risk themselves. The better way to think of this is that the AI governance actor is responsible for holding responsible the actor who is properly responsible. It would be recursive that AI governance actor is themselves responsible. Would we propose some meta-AI-goverance governor who holds responsible the AI governance actors that fail to hold responsible the actors that should be responsible? This is not the right way of thinking. We can rightly say that AI governance actors are responsible for some meta issues, like ensuring that Governments are properly informed etc."</li>
