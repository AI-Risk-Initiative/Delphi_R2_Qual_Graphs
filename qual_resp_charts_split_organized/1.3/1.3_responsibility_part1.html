They have agency over primary use-cases for leveraging AI, with purposeful design and model selection being critical steps. Users also typically have responsibility to monitor AI systems and detect unequal performance, and are responsible to give feedback.

They're not a powerless actor -- they are using the system and can choose not to if it is not adequately performant.

Further, the responsibility to monitor the AI system also typically falls on the user, and consequently my assessment is that they are moderately responsible for detecting unequal performance across user-groups."</li>                    <li>"users are responsible to give feedback."</li>                    <li>"Users are not only the people effected by unequal performance, but the people using a system to effect others unequally.

They have agency over primary use-cases for leveraging AI, with purposeful design and model selection being critical steps. Users also typically have responsibility to monitor AI systems and detect unequal performance, and are responsible to give feedback. Some noted users are not only people affected by unequal performance but also people using systems to affect others unequally, so they retain some responsibility even if minimal.</p>

They're not a powerless actor -- they are using the system and can choose not to if it is not adequately performant.
