Putting the responsibility with model developers is wrong-headed, as no system is expected to secure itself (thx Godel!).  Model developers may deploy their models (especially as services), in which case they are a Deployer.  But otherwise the consensus view that Model Developers are primarily responsible for security vulnerabilities doesn't reflect reality.

The better way to think of this is that the AI governance actor is responsible for holding responsible the actor who is properly responsible.
