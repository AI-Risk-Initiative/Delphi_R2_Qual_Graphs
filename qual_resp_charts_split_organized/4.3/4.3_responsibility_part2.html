They must create evaluation matrices and public scorecards showing risk levels "beyond profit motive." Deployers control the critical operational layer - they "operate keys, CI/CD, networks, and incident response" and determine context of use. As one expert notes, the same model can be used for defensive penetration testing or attacks - "the context of use is what matters, not the capability." Deployers have "direct influence over real-world applications" despite unclear legal boundaries with developers.</p>

                    <li>"I continue to assess that AI governance actors are "minimally responsible". I think a category error is at work here. Saying AI governance actors are responsible for AI risks is like saying that judges are responsible for crimes being committed. The kind of responsibility a judge has is very different from the kind of responsibility that a criminal or a lock-pick-maker has. 

The better way to think of this is that the AI governance actor is responsible for holding responsible the actor who is properly responsible. It would be recursive that AI governance actor is themselves responsible. Would we propose some meta-AI-goverance governor who holds responsible the AI governance actors that fail to hold responsible the actors that should be responsible? 

This is not the right way of thinking. We can rightly say that AI governance actors are responsible for some meta issues, like ensuring that Governments are properly informed etc."</li>
