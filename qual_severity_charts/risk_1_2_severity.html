Main harms identified include documented loss of life, long-term impacts on children from toxic content exposure, and hyper-realistic harmful content generated from real images. Several experts note this risk amplifies existing problems rather than creating new ones, with toxic content already widespread online and AI shifting the baseline from "1 to 2" rather than "0 to 1." Under Business as Usual, experts expect minor to substantial harm as the velocity and reach of toxic content increases. Under Pragmatic Mitigations, stronger safety filters, improved platform moderation, provenance tools, and synthetic media labeling meaningfully reduce velocity and reach, shifting probability toward lower severity levels. Residual risks persist due to jailbreaking, multilingual moderation gaps, adversarial adaptation, and the possibility that control frameworks drive activity to unregulated corners with worse outcomes, though catastrophic harm remains unlikely without compounding factors like widespread institutional collapse.</p>

                                <li>"Exposure to toxic and unsafe content has already led to loss of life, long-term impacts on children due to potential exposure to toxic content, and impact on real-life people due to hyper-realistic harmful content (pornographic or illegal activities) generated based on real-life images."</li>
                                <li>"- Under pragmatic, cost-effective mitigations (e.g., stronger default safety filters in mainstream models, improved platform moderation and provenance tools, labeling of synthetic media, advertiser pressure, and targeted enforcement against harassment), the velocity and reach of toxic content are meaningfully reduced, shifting probability toward minor and substantial harms.

- Residual risks persist due to jailbreaking, multi-lingual moderation gaps and adversary adaptation. During high-salience events (elections, conflicts), coordinated campaigns can still produce severe, localized impacts in some jurisdictions with weaker institutions.

- Catastrophic outcomes from toxic content alone within five years remain unlikely; they would require compounding factors (e.g., widespread institutional collapse), but a small tail risk is retained given global interconnectedness and rapid generative tooling advances."</li>
                                <li>"Exposure to toxic content is most likely to result in minor to substantial harms; catastrophic harms are very unlikely. With pragmatic mitigations, risks of high-severity harms are reduced somewhat, but cannot be fully eliminated."</li>
                                <li>"Increase in governance and guardrails will likely reduce the likelihood of substantial harm."</li>
                                <li>"Hard to see the costs of this. I think it will primarily only be created when AI users intentionally do so, and the counterfactual might be worse in some cases (e.g. creating actual CSAM is worse than AI-generated CSAM). There's some question of using these materials and spreading them, but I think AI is likely to net decrease the amount of extreme content being shared through better filtering. There's also already a lot of extreme content out there created and the internet isn't flooded with it so :shrug:"</li>
                                <li>"I think it's important to remember that we already live in a world where this information is available, AI will help amplify and possibly target it, but we are not going from 0 to 1 here, we are moving from 1 to 2 (or less). So, in general, I think it's clear that Minor events already take place and are expected, and Substantial events take place from time to time. If AI amplifies the current state, then it's possible a slight shift in Substantial events will increase. If Pragmatic Mitigation is used, it might decrease or it might not. Or like all control frameworks (prohibition), it might drive things underground or to unregulated corners and create worse outcomes."</li>
