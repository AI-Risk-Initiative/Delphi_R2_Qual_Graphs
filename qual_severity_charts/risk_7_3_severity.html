Under Business as Usual, substantial harm is most probable as systems expand faster than resilience frameworks can develop. Key concerns include operational failures in critical contexts (healthcare, finance), with potential for "huge losses" in financial models or national security applications.</p>

                                <li>"AI systems will continue to exhibit brittleness, hallucination, and failure under unexpected inputs or adversarial conditions. Substantial harms are most probable, including operational failures, misinformation, and poor decision support in critical contexts such as healthcare or finance. Severe harms could arise where overreliance on under-tested systems causes large-scale service disruption or safety incidents. Catastrophic outcomes remain possible if fragile AI components underpin critical national infrastructure or defense systems without fallback mechanisms. With pragmatic mitigations-such as stress testing, model interpretability, fail-safe design, and human oversight-risk levels fall considerably. Most harms shift to minor or substantial, as improved robustness, validation, and resilience engineering make AI systems more predictable, secure, and dependable"</li>
                                <li>"Research by both technology providers as well as academicians have been focused on robustness and there are quite a few controls available that can be implemented. However, as the technology continues to evolve, so should robustness approaches and frameworks, and with a similar pace."</li>
                                <li>"huge losses can occur with lack of robustness in financial and management models, or even in models that national security depends on."</li>
                                <li>"Under the Pragmatic Mitigations scenario: there is still 120 severe harm and 10% catastrophic harm due to uneven implementation, evolving technology, and complex interdependencies across sectors."</li>
                                <li>"If AI suffers from a lack of capability or robustness, I believe communities will place less trust to developer large scale solutions with high impacted in regulated environments."</li>
                                <li>"For Business as Usual conditions, uneven system design standards, limited stress testing, and weak oversight make substantial harm the most probable outcome, with a meaningful risk of severe or even catastrophic failures in critical applications.

For Pragmatic Mitigations, which includes broader adoption of model validation, continuous monitoring, and resilience controls, reducing the overall likelihood and scale of harm. While substantial harm remains the central risk due to inconsistent implementation and exposure to legacy systems, the probability of severe or catastrophic outcomes declines, reflecting a more mature but still imperfect risk management environment."</li>
                                <li>"Robustness can be mitigated but it is a hard problem and unclear what the progress will be."</li>
                                <li>"Robustness is a critical issue, especially in high stakes domains such as medicine. However, I expect pragmatic safety efforts to be able to identify and reduce these risks."</li>
                                <li>"Pretty unsure how people will deploy agents in the real world. But likely to be chaotic by default, and can maybe be mitigated somewhat. But also some cost for this risk in exchange for agents might be reasonable, e.g. people also make costly mistakes and we still hire them."</li>
