Developers are not necessarily the ones who feel the pain of mishaps. Its the orgs using the AI systems and the downstream actors who are affected by that use.
If GPT-6 is bad, other than OpenAI failing to convert on hype, it's the downstream users who would feel the pain of the model being unable to do the tasks those users want the model to do. OpenAI only feels that as a user, not as the developer. Likewise for other developer types."</li>                    <li>"Nearly everyone is vulnerable to lack of capability in the models.  Users/deployers more than the model makers themselves."</li>                    <li>"Developers and deployers are primarily exposed to this as a business risk, given that they are leveraged and investing heavily. The remaining question is whether it will bankrupt them, or just cause a minor crash - this seems to point to minor exposure.

Users, however, will potentially increasingly not be able to tell if AI systems are robust to changing conditions or not."</li>
