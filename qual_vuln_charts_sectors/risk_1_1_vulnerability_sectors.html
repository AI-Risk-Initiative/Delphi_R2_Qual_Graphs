I still rate these as less severe than the public administration impacts, as adverse decision risks in a market can be mitigated through competition.

For example, utility disconnection affects health and employment; transportation discrimination limits access to jobs and services; retail credit denial restricts economic mobility.

My initial assessment underestimated both the exposure and sensitivity of this sector to AI-driven discrimination and misrepresentation. AI systems are now deeply embedded in credit decisions for utility access, algorithmic routing and pricing in transportation/delivery, and, in some cases, resource allocation in utilities. Also, these are essential services where exclusion or discrimination has severe, cascading consequences. For example, utility disconnection affects health and employment; transportation discrimination limits access to jobs and services; retail credit denial restricts economic mobility. The sector also exhibits concerning structural factors: near-monopolistic conditions (especially utilities in some countries), significant power asymmetries between providers and consumers, historical patterns of geographic and demographic discrimination that AI systems risk encoding, and opacity in algorithmic decision-making that makes discrimination difficult to detect or challenge.

Even small instances of discrimination by the public sector can significantly impact people. Automated decision systems translate policy bias into algorithmic permanence, and lack of interpretability and accountability makes redress almost impossible once harm occurs. Government decisions are often a functional monopoly and control the use of force—a government might imprison or execute, making the magnitude of discriminatory decisions higher than market-based sectors. Welfare eligibility algorithms have demonstrated racial and socioeconomic bias in benefit distribution. Concerns were raised about authenticity of evidence (deepfakes) in courts.</p>

Lack of interpretability and accountability makes redress almost impossible once harm occurs."</li>                    <li>"Public administration excluding National Security updated to Extremely vulnerable. The reason being, in my holiday back in Singapore this year September, I caught up with my friend who is also a lawyer. She is now focused on Cybersecurity and Data Privacy law. We had a good conversation and one of which is, in next 5 years, can we still trust and believe that authenticity of images and audio files submitted to court as evidence in the day of age of AI? Deepfake existed before AI but with AI, those deepfake audios and videos are becoming better. Based on that discussion, I have updated my assessment from the first round."</li>                    <li>"Public Administration: Moderately Vulnerable because this sector might impact legitimacy and  inequality."</li>                    <li>"The comments about the flow on downstream effects on human life from adverse financial industry decisions made me re-asses the financial impacts upwards.  I still rate these as less severe than the public administration impacts, as adverse decision risks in a market can be mitigated through competition. Government decisions are often a functional monopoly, and control the use of force based on those decisions.  A bank might foreclose, bankrupt and send out debt collectors, but a government might imprison or execute. The magnitude of impact from discriminatory decisions is higher."</li>                    <li>"Even small instances of discrimination by the public sector can impact people, and then national security can make life and death decisions so misrepresentation there can have the highest level of consequences."</li>                    <li>"I continue to see real estate, education, health and public services are being most impacted due to the large scale impact it can have on everyone's life"</li>                    <li>"Public Administration excluding National Security (Extremely Vunerable)

National security can make life-and-death decisions, so misrepresentation can have the highest level of consequences. Small countries that can't invest adequate resources for AI deployment in defense will be highly vulnerable, as national security capability is becoming directly proportional to AI investment. Small nations may face vulnerability to AI-powered attacks without resources to build defensive AI systems.</p>
