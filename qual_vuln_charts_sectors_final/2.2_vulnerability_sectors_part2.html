                    <li>"Information and natsec sectors seems less vulnerable than, eg the retail sector, because they are more hardened. I interpreted the question not to reflect whether malicious actors would seek to exploit vulnerabilities in a given sector, but instead how vulnerable each sector would be assuming a malicious actor sought to target them."</li>                    <li>"While I agree that public/defense sectors are very sensitive to adversarial attacks, the extensive compliance and bureaucratic procedures ensure that these sectors will not drastically increase exposure by adopting AI solutions in a reckless way. The current level of the pressure to adopt AI, with respect to the capabilities of said AI, is not high enough to leapfrog the very procedural nature of technology adoption. That said, if that pressure or capability increases - as could happen if competition between states increases - I will modify my estimate."</li>
