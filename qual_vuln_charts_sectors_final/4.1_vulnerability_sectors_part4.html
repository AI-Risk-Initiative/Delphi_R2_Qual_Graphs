All staff are vulnerable to psychosocial attacks, and sectors with intellectual property face additional surveillance risks from AI infiltration that may be undetectable.</p>

Trade, Transportation, and Utilities: I selected "Highly vulnerable" because this sector is increasingly connected to smart infrastructure and relies on public trust in logistics, schedules, and supply chains. Even small manipulations (e.g., false alerts, manipulated GPS data) can cause cascading disruptions."</li>                    <li>"Surveillance and manipulation aren't limited by industry as much as some other threats.  a physical offline presence may provide some protection for some users, but in general the staff and customers within all industries are equally vulnerable to psychosocial human factor attacks and manipulation.  ask yourself "Does advertising work in my industry?" If it does, then you have this risk.  

Surveillance carries some additional risk to industries that depend on industry secrets and intellectual property, since an actor which used AI avatars to infiltrate staff, or agentic cyber attacks to infiltrate systems, would be capable of extracting that information.  If the interactions are happening with staff on personal devices outside of work, the data loss may not be detectable.
 
Countries tend to require staff in highly classified or sensitive positions to disclose all contact with foreign nationals,  but not contact with AI.  This enables AI to act as a proxy to bypass traditional security controls.  models can act as sleeper agents and manchurian candidates, meaning any nefarious programming can lay dormant and undetectable until the model is exposed to specific kinds of information or people.  This behaviour can persist undetected across airgaps, and may be so subtle the end user can't notice they are leaking information. 

There isn't an organisation or industry which has effective counter measures against these risks, and there is evidence of these threats existing in the AI ecosystem already."</li>                    <li>"I'm very surprised by the low consensus for trade, transportation, and utilities, which to me are obviously key vectors for any physical manifestation of a successful disinfo campaign."</li>
