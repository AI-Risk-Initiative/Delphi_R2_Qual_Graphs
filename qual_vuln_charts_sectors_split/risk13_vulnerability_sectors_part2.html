I suppose that National Security more generally (not just the NatSec community) is weakened when e.g. the economy/critical infrastructure is highly dependent on a few actors. On the other hand, concentration of National Security risks might also make them more defendable. For example, if there is only one AI developer with systems capable of developing novel bio-weapons, that would better for National Security than if there were 5 (because monitoring and defending one actor is easier to do than 5)."</li>

AI tools function as cognitive prostheses that extend or substitute human decision-making across contexts, so exposure spans all workflows. Network effects, data moats, compute scale, and platform lock-in concentrate control and rents; operational dependencies then amplify indirect harms, which this question counts.
