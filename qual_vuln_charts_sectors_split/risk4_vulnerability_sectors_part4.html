Exposure: Citizen-service portals, benefits/tax/permits casework, and AI assistants for intake/summarization/RAG routinely handle cross-agency records; legacy systems and multi-vendor stacks add misconfiguration and logging risk.
Sensitivity: Files contain extensive PII/financial/health-adjacent data on vulnerable populations; compromise or correct inference undermines public trust and can trigger statutory breach duties and legal exposure.
Why not Extreme: Many agencies use compartmentalized systems, formal DPIAs, and strict retention/FOIA processes that reduce broad plaintext access. I would rate Extreme for agencies processing particularly sensitive files at scale (e.g., welfare/health, child services, criminal justice) with model/output logs retained by vendors."</li>                    <li>"Healthcare, Finance, National Security, and Public Administration face extreme vulnerability due to handling highly sensitive personal data.

While they may not handle highly sensitive data directly, they often interface with systems that do. Risks include leaks of personal information through misconfigured AI tools or chatbots, and inference risks where AI in hiring or HR processes deduces sensitive traits leading to discrimination or privacy breaches. However, this is a diverse set with different resources and data—cleaning services have low risk while private equity using AI for holdings and strategy has much higher risk due to high-value data. These sectors contain very interesting information making them vulnerable, and handle information as sensitive as healthcare or finance but subject to far less regulation.</p>

Exposure: SIS/LMS platforms, tutoring/proctoring tools, admissions/financial-aid workflows, and teacher/staff use of LLMs over student work create regular model contact with identifiable content; districts often mix vendors, creating broad logging/telemetry surfaces.
Sensitivity: Records include minors' data, grades, IEPs/disability accommodations, immigration and aid info; harms from leakage or inference (e.g., disability/discipline status) are significant and long-lived, with FERPA/COPPA/state-law implications.

Exposure: Citizen-service portals, benefits/tax/permits casework, and AI assistants for intake/summarization/RAG routinely handle cross-agency records; legacy systems and multi-vendor stacks add misconfiguration and logging risk.
Sensitivity: Files contain extensive PII/financial/health-adjacent data on vulnerable populations; compromise or correct inference undermines public trust and can trigger statutory breach duties and legal exposure.
Why not Extreme: Many agencies use compartmentalized systems, formal DPIAs, and strict retention/FOIA processes that reduce broad plaintext access.
