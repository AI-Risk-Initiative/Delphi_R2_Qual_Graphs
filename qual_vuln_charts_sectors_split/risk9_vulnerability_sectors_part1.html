                            <p class="summary-text"><strong>AI-generated summary of expert comments:</strong> Experts emphasize these sectors face high vulnerability despite physical operations providing some offline fallback options. Large farms are highly automated and AI-dependent - attacks could seriously impact food supplies. Critical infrastructure like utilities presents hidden attack surfaces, with power grids vulnerable to disruption that could delay AI training runs for months. Experts warn of "out of bound" AI-enabled attacks using novel vectors like electromagnetic frequencies bypassing routers, power line data transmission, or sound-based mapping that traditional monitoring can't detect. Industrial control systems and AI-driven machinery in these sectors present high casualty and economic disruption potential if compromised.</p>

                    <li>"Physical industries have some defense due to being able to fallback to offline options.  Any highly digitised sector is highly vulnerable.   Despite being physical, critical infrastructure is also vulnerable as it can become a target to disrupt downstream sectors.   Utilities in particular are effectively a hidden attack surface for all companies that use power.  As AI training runs require long periods of stable power supply, a rival country may be able to buy several months in a race by destroying transformers or power supply and distribution capabilities, even if they can't hack the AI company itself.

The other threat to power companies, is AI being able to learn and transmit novel messaging protocols in novel domains. this may allow power transfer itself to function as an attack vector.  Data can be passed over powerlines, and subtle variations in power supply can be used to change processing inside CPUs.  This has been demonstrated experimentally, but isn't yet widespread because its quite difficult for humans to pull off.  A model trained on this task may be capable of conducting "out of bound" attacks that bypass traditional monitoring altogether. 

Similar out of bound attacks are made possible by AI in multiple other domains. electro magnetic frequencies can be used for non-traditional cyber attacks that bypass routers to  change system memory.  Sound can be used to map spaces, or create localised pressure or heating.  One could go on at length as the literature is replete with attacks in various domains.  The time to move these from the lab to production is typically limited by the availability of human security researchers.  A scaled agentic cyber capability would be able to pursue many of these non-traditional lines of attack simultaneously.   It is unlikely even experience cyber security leaders would detect many of these attacks, let alone non-cyber industries in domains where an orthogonal AI cyber attack vector exist"</li>                    <li>"For agriculture, most large farms and ranches are highly automated and will be (are currently) using AI.

                    <li>"Physical industries have some defense due to being able to fallback to offline options.  Any highly digitised sector is highly vulnerable.   Despite being physical, critical infrastructure is also vulnerable as it can become a target to disrupt downstream sectors.   Utilities in particular are effectively a hidden attack surface for all companies that use power.  As AI training runs require long periods of stable power supply, a rival country may be able to buy several months in a race by destroying transformers or power supply and distribution capabilities, even if they can't hack the AI company itself.

The other threat to power companies, is AI being able to learn and transmit novel messaging protocols in novel domains. this may allow power transfer itself to function as an attack vector.  Data can be passed over powerlines, and subtle variations in power supply can be used to change processing inside CPUs.  This has been demonstrated experimentally, but isn't yet widespread because its quite difficult for humans to pull off.  A model trained on this task may be capable of conducting "out of bound" attacks that bypass traditional monitoring altogether. 

Similar out of bound attacks are made possible by AI in multiple other domains. electro magnetic frequencies can be used for non-traditional cyber attacks that bypass routers to  change system memory.  Sound can be used to map spaces, or create localised pressure or heating.  One could go on at length as the literature is replete with attacks in various domains.  The time to move these from the lab to production is typically limited by the availability of human security researchers.  A scaled agentic cyber capability would be able to pursue many of these non-traditional lines of attack simultaneously.   It is unlikely even experience cyber security leaders would detect many of these attacks, let alone non-cyber industries in domains where an orthogonal AI cyber attack vector exist"</li>                    <li>"Mass-harm exposure concentrates in OT and life-safety systems and in dual-use R and D.

I think participants are overweighting finance by not accounting for its already quite conservative and hardened status, as well as its lack of vulnerability to non-cyber and casualty-causing harms. National security is similarly relatively hardened, though is a prime target and sensitive to all kinds of attacks, so I have upweighted it a little."</li>                    <li>"Mass-harm exposure concentrates in OT and life-safety systems and in dual-use R and D.
