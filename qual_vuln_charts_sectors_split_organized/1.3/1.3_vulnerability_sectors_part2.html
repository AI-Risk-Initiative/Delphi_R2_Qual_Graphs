Experts rate scientific research extremely vulnerable as unequal AI performance directly impacts research validity. Well-resourced groups using high-quality AI gain advantages, squeezing out poorer researchers. AI's heterogeneous success across domains creates resource misallocation risks. Biased outcomes reaching market without due diligence particularly harm marginalized groups in this fundamental human rights sector.</p>

Experts rate scientific research extremely vulnerable as unequal AI performance directly impacts research validity. Well-resourced groups using high-quality AI gain advantages, squeezing out poorer researchers. AI's heterogeneous success across domains creates resource misallocation risks. Biased outcomes reaching market without due diligence particularly harm marginalized groups in this fundamental human rights sector.</p>
