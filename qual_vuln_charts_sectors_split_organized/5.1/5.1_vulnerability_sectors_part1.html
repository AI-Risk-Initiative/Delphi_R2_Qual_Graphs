For mining/manufacturing, for instance, my mind goes to using an AI system that is inadequate for the job and causes a massive oil spill. The probability there feels high and the impact would be enormous."</li>                    <li>"Large farms using AI will try to improve yields and reduce costs using AI.  The hazard of a risk being realized is that food production can be substantially affected (consider an AI putting herbicide instead of fertilizer on a crop).  The farmers and ranchers using less AI are less vulnerable.  Based on friends in agriculture, the largest are more likely to (over)use AI than others.
